- 👋 Hi, I’m @nvlgzr, but you can call me Elbong
- 👀 I’m interested in: life, death, insects, chaos, ecstasy, image composition, svelte, and, when absolutely necessary, people
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about: cognition and consciousness within the species _Homo sapiens_, and other forms of artificial intelligence
- 📫 To reach me: post to the discussions on one of these projects:
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - [_fngrng_](https://fngrng.navelgazer.club): a typing trainer focussed on accuracy, and [written](https://github.com/nvlgzr/fngrng) in Svelte
  - [_notion2svelte_](https://github.com/nvlgzr/notion2svelte): Write in Notion. Publish with Svelte.
