- 👋 Hi, I’m @nvlgzr
- 👀 I’m interested in: life, death, insects, chaos, ecstasy, image composition, svelte, and, when absolutely necessary, people
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about: neurology and consciousness, particularly as measured in the species _Homo sapiens_
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: my first fully-realized svelte app: fngrng, a typing trainer
- 📫 To reach me: for now, just file a GitHub Issue
